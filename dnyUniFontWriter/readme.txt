Description:
	This program is a tool to be used for using various fontsets available via Unicode in other applications.
	When activated the program replaces the letters from a-z with the letters of a currently selected fontset
	regardless where you type in your text. Fonts can be defined via text-files. It uses UTF-16 encoding.
	Note: The target window where you type must support UTF-16 encoding in order to display the fontset
	properly. If not, it results in unwanted Unicode characters or other unwanted characters.

Usage:
	- Start the program
	- Select a fontset of your choice (remembered on next program start)
	- Activate the tool
	- Your selected fontset is now available wherever you type
	- Deactivate the tool in order to use normal letters again
	- The program can be started with the parameter "-hide" in order to hide it on startup

System Requirements:
	- Platform: x64
	- Operating System: Compatible Windows OS
	- Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 x64 Redistributable
	- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 or higher
